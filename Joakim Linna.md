Hello! My name is Kim and I am one of the founders of FFA.
I have a bachelors in game development and am at the time of writing taking a masters in immersive technology. 

I specialize in game design and programming and I constantly start and prototype new projects. I'm also very comfortable with Git so if you have any questions I can probably help.

Outside of development I like skateboarding and actually playing video games.

If you want to get in direct contact with me, send me an email at KimMakesGames@gmail.com
